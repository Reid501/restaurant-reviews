#BB Junior Developer Task

## Intro
Prior to interview we'd like you to complete a small technical task to discuss 
on the day. We've tried to keep the task relatively straightforward as we're 
aware that personal time isn't necessarily always in huge supply. 

## Folder Contents
This folder contains a small JSON file containing restaurant information and 
a number of image files which you'll need in order to complete the task.

## Tasks
What we'd like you to do: 

1. Layout the page as supplied.

2. When a thumbnail is clicked a panel should display containing more 
information about the selected restaurant. The information should be 
inserted dynamically using the data supplied in the JSON file. 

3. Allow users to close the panel when the cross icon is clicked. 

4. Include a level of responsiveness so that it's usable on mobile and tablet devices. 

5. Ensure a consistent layout across Chrome, Safari and Firefox. 

If time allows, do feel free to add your own creative flourishes in terms of hover 
states and transitions (how the panel moves in and out of view, for example).

## Technology Choices
You're free to choose which tools you use to implement this, however our preference
would be for it to be put together using the languages and/or frameworks you would be
working with on a daily basis as part of this role as set out in the original job 
advert (recap below):

1. HTML/CSS/SASS
2. PHP
2. Vanilla JavaScript
3. jQuery
4. React
5. Vue

What we're really looking to get a sense of here though is your methodology and your 
approach to programming and problem solving. 

Good luck!
