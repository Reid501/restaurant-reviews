## Tasks
What we'd like you to do: 

1. Layout the page as supplied.

2. When a thumbnail is clicked a panel should display containing more 
information about the selected restaurant. The information should be 
inserted dynamically using the data supplied in the JSON file. 

3. Allow users to close the panel when the cross icon is clicked. 

4. Include a level of responsiveness so that it's usable on mobile and tablet devices. 

5. Ensure a consistent layout across Chrome, Safari and Firefox. 

If time allows, do feel free to add your own creative flourishes in terms of hover 
states and transitions (how the panel moves in and out of view, for example).
